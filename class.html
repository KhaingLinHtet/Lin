            Taekwondo is one of the most systematic and scientific Korean traditional martial arts, that teaches more than physical fighting skills. It is a discipline that shows ways of enhancing our spirit and life through training our body and mind. Today, it has become a global sport that has gained an international reputation, and stands among the official games in the Olympics. But Taekwondo is very different from many such oriental martial arts. First, physically it is very dynamic with active movements that include a mirage of foot skills. Second, the principle physical movements are in simpatico with that of the mind and life as a whole. Third, it possesses dynamic poses from another perspective

            Muay Thai is a stand-up combat sport, where fighters are not allowed to take the fight to the ground. It is fast-paced and combines both boxing and kicking in one swirling melee of a bout. In Thailand, it is known as the art of eight limbs, referring to the eight points of contact that are used to strike the opponent. The sport uses the human body to mimic the weapons and combat of centuries gone by. The fist takes the place of the sword and daggers, and the elbow emulates the crushing mace. The feet and knees take the place of the axe and staff. The shins and forearms are specially trained and hardened to play the role of armor and shield and are used to block blows. In practice, the sport uses a combination of punches, elbow strikes, kicks and knee strikes, to create one of the most exhilarating and bloody combat sports today.
